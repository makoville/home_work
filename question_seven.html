    <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">The art of war</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">In the art of war it talks about  when to fight and when not to fight: avoid what is <b><i>strong</i></b> and strike at what is <b><i>weak</i></b>. Know how to <b><i>deceive</i></b> the enemy: appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak. Know your strengths and weaknesses: if you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.</p>

    <p>by Sun Tzu</p>
